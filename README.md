SimjectTest
-----------

SimjectTest allows the user to quickly determine if Simject successfully resprung your simulator by showing you an alert at relaunch of the Springboard that informs you the respring was successful. 

Huge thanks to Ca13ra1 for helping me update the code from using deprecated functions and making things easier for initial install.
